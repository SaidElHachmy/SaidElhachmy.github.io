                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome! Iâ€™m a dedicated English teacher passionate about language and education. Born on July 29, 1996, I graduated from the High Professional Institute of Languages and Translation in Nouadhibou, with a specialty in language studies. My mission is to support students in their journey toward language mastery.</p>
                <p>In addition to teaching, I have a love for movies, football, painting, drawing, and music. I believe in continuous learning, building strong relationships, and achieving results through dedication.</p>
